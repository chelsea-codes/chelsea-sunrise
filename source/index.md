# Hi Friend!

I’m **Chelsea Gille**. You could call this my profile site, but I hope to grow it into a [digital garden](https://refinedmind.co/digital-garden) of sorts. :)

If you want to know about my education, work history, and the technical skills I've used, please see my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/chelseagille) profile. 

Also, see what this [website is made of](./projects) if you're interested!

## Career Goal
I'm grateful that my professional experiences have allowed me to engage in nearly every aspect of creating, maintaining, delivering, and supporting software, so now I'm focusing on opportunities to build specialization and expertise.

I'm currently exploring roles in full-stack or backend development, devops, and support engineering!

## Beyond Career

I’m a wife and a new mom that values family, authenticity, optimism, curiosity, kindness, and resilience.

I find joy in making lists, reading, doing [jigsaw puzzles](./puzzling), and trying new hobbies.

I'm definitely a dog person, but I'll still think your cat is adorable! My dog's name is Duke.

One of my favorite game series is *The Sims* (*The Sims 2* being my favorite installment).

Feel free to [contact me](./contact) - even if it’s just to say hello!

See ya around! :)
