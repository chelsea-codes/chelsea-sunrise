# Hi Friend!

I’m **Chelsea Gille**, a full-stack developer who’s interested in doing and learning a little bit of everything!

While working at the University of Wisconsin for the past four years, I’ve had the opportunity to contribute to nearly every aspect of software development. I love writing code, but when I get to establish cloud architecture, design APIs, and build the CI/CD processes that help my team develop more efficiently and confidently, that is icing on the cake!

I feel most inspired while building solutions that give any human tools to create a fulfilling and successful life - *however they define it*. 

As a team member, I strive to be an encouraging presence and help create an environment where everyone, regardless of title, can share their ideas without judgement.

## Beyond Developer

I’m a to-do list fanatic, a reader, a [puzzler](./puzzling), and my lifelong hobby is exploring new hobbies. I also find joy in observing the weirdness of nature, petting my dog Duke, and watching Twitch streams of nostalgic video games with my wonderful husband Adam.

Checkout some things I’m [currently up to](./currently) and feel free to [contact me](./contact) - even if it’s just to say hello!

See ya around! :)
