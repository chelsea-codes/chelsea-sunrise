# Hi Friend!

I’m **Chelsea Gille**, a developer-turned-support engineer who’s interested in doing and learning a little bit of everything!

While working at the University of Wisconsin for the past four years, I’ve had the opportunity to contribute to nearly every aspect of software development. I also spent a lot of time providing technical support for our applications which I found to be very engaging and rewarding because I enjoy solving problems, learning new technology, and helping others. That is why I decided to pursue a new path as a support engineer!

As a team member, I strive to be an encouraging presence and help create an environment where everyone, regardless of title or experience, can share their ideas without judgement.

## Beyond Career

I’m a to-do list fanatic, a reader, a [puzzler](./puzzling), and my lifelong hobby is exploring new hobbies! I also find joy in observing the weirdness of nature, petting my dog Duke, and watching Twitch streams of nostalgic video games with my wonderful husband Adam.

Checkout some things I’m [currently up to](./currently), what this [website is made of](./projects), and feel free to [contact me](./contact) - even if it’s just to say hello!

See ya around! :)
