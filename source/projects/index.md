# Side Projects

## But first! A word from our sponsor...

Just kidding, I don’t have a sponsor, but I do believe in the following idea:

[It’s okay to not have a side project.](https://code.likeagirl.io/its-okay-not-to-have-a-side-project-b1a109e636f1)
>  The story is told that if you get home from work and you’re not brimming with enthusiasm to write more code, then you’re not passionate about your job, you’re not interested in honing your craft, and you’re stagnating. There is value in side projects, of course. ... In truth, having the time, energy, and focus to work on a side project is a privilege. Treating side projects as a defining feature of a good software developer excludes a huge number of people.

***Back to the show!***

## You are here! -> chelsea-sunrise.com

At least that was the original domain name... I honestly couldn't justify the cost of the domain when it was time to renew. :)

Officially my profile site, but I hope to grow it into a [digital garden](https://refinedmind.co/digital-garden) of sorts. I also want it to be simple to maintain, update with new content, and deploy.

## Baby Gille

My short-term goal for Baby Gille is to make him laugh as much as I can. My long-term goal is to do what I can to help him love life.
