# Side Projects

## You are here! -> chelsea-sunrise.com

At least that was the original domain name... I honestly couldn't justify the cost of the domain when it was time to renew. :)

Officially my profile site, but I hope to grow it into a [digital garden](https://refinedmind.co/digital-garden) of sorts. I also want it to be simple to maintain, update with new content, and deploy.

*   Static hosting using [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com)

## Baby Gille

My short-term goal for Baby Gille is to make him laugh as much as I can. My long-term goal is to do what I can to help him love life.
