# Side Projects

## But first! A word from our sponsor...

Just kidding, I don’t have a sponsor, but I do believe in the following sentiment:

[It’s okay to not have a side project.](https://code.likeagirl.io/its-okay-not-to-have-a-side-project-b1a109e636f1)
>  The story is told that if you get home from work and you’re not brimming with enthusiasm to write more code, then you’re not passionate about your job, you’re not interested in honing your craft, and you’re stagnating. There is value in side projects, of course. ... In truth, having the time, energy, and focus to work on a side project is a privilege. Treating side projects as a defining feature of a good software developer excludes a huge number of people.

***Back to the show!***

## You are here! -> chelsea-sunrise.com

My primary goal for this site is to show you a glimpse of who I am beyond the customary one-page resume. I also want it to be simple to maintain, update with new content, and deploy.

[Source code available on Github!](https://github.com/chelsea-codes/chelsea-sunrise)

**Stack:**

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)

*   [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) with the [Cactus](https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus) theme

*   Static hosting using Cloudflare [Worker](https://www.workers.cloudflare.com) and [CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/) 

# Ideas In Progress

The following are some ideas that have been rolling around in my head recently. I’ve only been dabbling in the tech needed to develop them, but I will update here with repository links once I have a more concrete start on them.

## KonMari Tidy Up (Web/Mobile App)

This app will walk a user through the process of Marie Kondo’s [“Life-Changing Magic Of Tidying Up”](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22318578-the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up), hopefully making their tidying journey less overwhelming. [The process](https://konmari.com/about-the-konmari-method/) seems simple, but in my experience it’s a daunting but rewarding mission that’s meant to be completed in under six months.

Along the tidying journey, this app will reward the user with sharable badges, provide KonMari tips and resources, and eventually allow them to take, compare, and share before and after photos on social media. I want to create an app that “Sparks Joy” (as Marie Kondo says) for everyone who uses it!

This app is a learning opportunity for me since I have limited experience with front-end frameworks and have primarily written JavaScript for server-side code. With that said, I still hope to share it with the world and incorporate user feedback.

**Tentative Stack:**

* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) or [Realm](https://realm.io/)

## Puzzler (2D Game - Mobile & Possibly PC)

It may seem like just another jigsaw puzzle game, but this one will have extra helpful features for those who prefer the solving over the sorting aspect of puzzling. I will incorporate a reward system, but am still figuring out how that might look. 

I’ve tried a ton of jigsaw puzzle games, but all of them seem to miss some critical features. I’d like to learn more about what users want from a puzzle game and try to incorporate that feedback into my game.

Checkout my [Unity Playground on Github](https://github.com/chelsea-codes/unity-playground/tree/main/Assets/Scripts)! These scripts are just for trying stuff out in Unity, but I think it’s important to learn by *doing*, even if it’s messy at first!

**Tentative Stack:**

* [Unity](https://unity.com/)

* C# (with Unity’s [Scripting API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/))

* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) or [Realm](https://realm.io/)
