# Puzzling

**I love jigsaw puzzles!** They give my mind a break and a workout at the same time... kinda like brain yoga.

I don't glue them and hang them up because I like the option of doing them more than once and it's theraputic to break them apart. You know, that feeling of 'letting go'. 

So here's a museum of some of the puzzles I've completed in the past! (P.S. I've always got more to add.)

## Puzzler's Tip:
Ask your local library if they loan jigsaw puzzles, some of them do! Don't expect them to have all the pieces, though. ðŸ™ƒ 

I like to put them together and send them back with a sticky note of how many pieces are missing. I've found some people really don't like missing pieces, but it doesn't bother me at all!
