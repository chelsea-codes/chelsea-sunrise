- **[Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range) by David Epstein**
> Plenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill, play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as possible.

But a closer look at research on the world's top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel laureates, shows that early specialization is the exception, not the rule.
